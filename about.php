            <h1>About Jotun Studios</h1>
            <p>Jotun Studios was born when its founder, David Dubois, created a personal website to serve as an online 
                portfolio and needed a domain name. The word "Jotun" comes from the Viking myths of gods, called "Aesir", 
                fighting giants, called "Jotun", to protect humanity from harm. The name stated David's goal of becoming a 
                giant in the realtime graphics industry.</p>

            <p>Jotun Studios was formalized as a company in 2017 when David decided to begin developing shaders for 
                the Windows 10 and XBox One versions of Minecraft and needed a legal business to apply to be a Content 
                Creator. Jotun Studios retains its founder's vision of delivering high-quality graphics to a variety of
                platforms.<p>
